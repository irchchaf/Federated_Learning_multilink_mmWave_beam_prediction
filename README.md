# Federated_Learning_multilink_mmWave_beam_prediction
This repository provides the main code for the project of leveraging Federated learning to predict the mmWave beamforming vectors locally, at each access-point, in a multi-link network. More details and results of this work can be found in our paper: Federated Channel-Beam Mapping: from sub-6GHz to mmWave
